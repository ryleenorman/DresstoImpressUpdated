# Dress To Impress Outfit Generating Website

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a webpage that generates an outfit for the user based on current weather data. During my creative process, I noticed my roommate complaining that the weather had ruined his shoes, which sparked my idea for a website to prevent just that. Not only did I want this website to save everyone’s nice shoes, I wanted to tie in an aspect to save myself time in the mornings, which is selecting an outfit. I spend a lot of my time on Pinterest looking for inspiration, so not only would this website be efficient for preparing for the weather, but also give a random generation of an outfit so that each day can be something new, without having to brainstorm or search for yourself. Currently, the website will give the user a randomly generated outfit and access to a weather source, but can not combine the two just yet. The concept is there along with the website design and color scheme, but could use a few functional details.


## Webpage Composition


### Index (Home Page)

The first page you land on when launching the website is the Index or Home Page. This page is composed of two Hero Images with buttons that take you to the two other pages and also descriptions of these pages. It is meant to be the most aesthetically pleasing page, as it is the first thing you see. While building this page I wanted to showcase more of a “brand image” or a certain type of branding to match with the name of the website. I used a good bit of custom CSS throughout the pages for different things, such as buttons or dividers to give a cleaner look. I also used the “Lux” theme from Bootswatch, as I also thought it was fitting for the brand image. Some of the code inspiration and research from this part of the website comes from W3Schools, such as the hero images and the dividers. After going to any of the other pages, you can navigate back to the home page by clicking the “Home” button in the navigation bar.


### Outfit Results

This page is linked to the first hero image button on the Home Page. This is where the user will go to get their generated outfit for the day. The page is made up of a two column layout from W3Schools. Currently, there is an anchored button that will take the user to the Weather Channel’s website to check their weather for that area. The next section there is a button that will randomly generate an outfit every time the user clicks the button. The function used is JavaScript that puts uploaded images from the developer into an array that chooses one at random each time. This was a personal idea that ChatGPT was able to clean up and help make my code functional.


### Look Book

This page is linked to the second hero image button on the Home Page. This is where the user can go to get season inspiration, more about the “brand image” and favorite picks from the creator. I wanted this page to give more personality to the brand and almost give the feel of a blog but a more refined and sophisticated version. It is composed of a four column layout also from W3Schools, for each of the four seasons of the year. At the bottom of the page there is a table with more details about inspiration for the outfit picks from the creator, which includes individuals known for their wardrobe picks, what their occupation was and what time period they are from. The table I used is one from the Bootstrap section on W3Schools. I also used a lot of my header tags throughout this page such as &lt;h1> and &lt;h2>.


## Research Summary

The research from other websites and repositories will be listed below. I did not use any code from these sources, but I did get most of my creative ideas and structure from these other websites and repositories. I knew that I wanted the user to be able to click certain buttons and have their outfit randomly generated for them based on their selections. When implementing the database and weather portion of my project, this idea will become more plausible, but for right now the user only has to click one button to get their outfit. A lot of my technical and design ideas came from all the different tabs on W3Schools. This is where most of my ideas started, and then if the code did not work as I had hoped, ChatGPT was able to clean up my mistakes.


### Competitive Analysis

The first website I chose is a well known sunscreen brand supported by dermatologists. The reason I chose this website is because there is an AI feature that allows the customer or user to answer questions in a multiple choice quiz. While looking at the URL and answering the questions, I noticed that it did not change based on my answers or things I clicked. The main thing that caught my attention that I was unfamiliar with was while I was inspecting the website I noticed something interesting within a Java Script tag. Within this tag was (**&lt;script async=""src="[https://cdn.automat-ai.com/eltamd/deployments/production/index.js](https://cdn.automat-ai.com/eltamd/deployments/production/index.js)">&lt;/script>) **where the website mentioned showed all the code for the AI that eltaMD was using for their interactive skin quizzes. I think this concept would be really useful to integrate if possible, as my project is an outfit generator which uses not only the users preference of style and occasion but also weather data.

Another thing I noticed but was familiar with in the inspection information was a specific &lt;div or division tag that the website used for a header that showed their credentials of being “Dermatologist Recommended” and their advertisements for that specific time period. (example from code: **&lt;div class="top-header-promo-banner">&lt;span>&lt;p style="font-size: 14px; ,font-family: Open Sans;">FREE SHIPPING AT $75 &amp; free sample in every order&lt;/p>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>). **Clearly this function is used by a lot of Retail sites to pull customers in based on promotions, so I think this is another feature that would be helpful to integrate for simulating marketing.

The second website I found is also very similar to the concept of the previous. Once again it is user input based to give a certain generated response, which is what I am looking for in my own website. This is a skincare quiz from Ulta Beauty that does not use AI, but is still in the format of a multiple choice question quiz based on what the customer needs. Once again, when selections in the quiz were made, my URL did not change like it did when routing from the homepage to the quiz. When the second page was displayed, the URL only changed from “[https://www.ulta.com](https://www.ulta.com)” to what is linked above. While using the inspect tab, I did find a few things I was familiar with. One of these included bootstrap and css for the layout of the website (example from code: **&lt;!--&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css)"**). Another was the picking of a very specific pink that is considered one of Ulta’s brand colors (example from code: **&lt;meta name="theme-color" content="#E90B5A">**). The last thing that I was familiar with in the inspection tab was a part of the website that was hidden at that specific time which was a chat feature you see on many websites for customer service purposes (example from code: **&lt;div role="region" aria-label="chat" style="visibility:hidden;" class="floated-chat-w" id="chat-window">**). One tag that I have seen a lot throughout this website is a tag called “iframe”. After doing some research, I learned through W3Schools that this is used to “embed another document within the current HTML document”. The visibility feature I found through this website would be helpful for hiding certain elements when they are not being used for my project.

The third website I picked is a quiz from BuzzFeed magazine about the user’s personal style taste. Not only is this very close to my current project idea, but once again it has the aspect of a quiz to pull specific information from the user. Once again there was nothing special in the URL other than the redirection from the homepage taking me to the page linked above. One element of this website that I found familiar were different uses of style in CSS (example from code: **style="display: none; width: 1px; height: 1px;" and &lt;style id="svelte-1e19no9">.ad-toolbar.loading.svelte-1e19no9{position:fixed;right:-500px}&lt;/style>**) Another element of this website that I recognized was the simple title tag. On this specific website, the title is pretty basic and is the first thing you see on the page along with ads (example from code: **&lt;title>The Era Of Fashion Your Styles Matches Most Quiz&lt;/title>**). I can use this title tag when creating my own webpage. One attribute that I saw over and over again that I was not familiar with was the term “sandbox” and it was also always paired with something relating to “iframe” which I had previously researched. According to W3Schools, “the sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe”, which gives more control relating to elements such as form submissions or disabling APIs.


### GitHub Repository Research

[https://github.com/Za1an/Buzzfeed-Quiz](https://github.com/Za1an/Buzzfeed-Quiz)

The first repository I found relates to many of the websites I researched previously. This GitHub project is based on the basic BuzzFeed quizzes you see throughout the internet. The ReadMe for this project is laid out over the course of three days, which includes planning, coding and final results. The goal and steps to achieve the goal are clearly outlined in the documentation. The user will go through a series of questions and will end with a specific total which will then give them results based on their answers (in their model, it is giving the user which tech company they should be placed in).

The second repository I found related to my idea very closely. The function of this project was a true outfit generator that took account of the type of event being attended, the weather conditions, and if the person was working out that day. Not only did this repository have photos of the landing page and its functions, the individuals that created the site listed problems they ran into along the way and how they solved these problems. I felt that it was very informational and had a very nice visual aspect to continue the planning process for my own project. Another aspect of this repository I found interesting was the use of a noSQL database to house the “wardrobe” that generated the outfits. The only thing I would integrate differently is the true weather data, instead of asking the user if it is raining outside or not.


## Future Enhancements

Some of the enhancements that I would like to incorporate in the future is a database to integrate the different outfit combinations for different seasons for more of a wide selection. I would also like to integrate conditional questions that are more tailored to the user like the previous websites I mentioned while researching. The only other enhancement I would like to add are more design based to make each of the web pages look more professional and sophisticated. I would also like to develop and design some of my own images for the website instead of using stock or images from Pinterest.

Class Lectures and Code


## Reflection on Resources

Most of my challenges came from the first design and creative processes and putting together the structure and composition of my web pages. It took awhile for me to plan how I wanted to lay out the elements on each page and which of those were going to be grouped together. I also spent some time on Pinterest looking for images that fit the aesthetic of the brand. Each image used on my website was found on Pinterest for now until I can make my own. One of the best resources I used was ChatGPT to find out where my code could be fixed or what part of the code was not working, so it saved a lot of time debugging. ChatGPT also helped me put my ideas into code such as the random image generator. I also utilized the recorded lectures to rewatch them multiple times to relearn and walk through certain topics I was confused about.
